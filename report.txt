Approaching the web scraping of Starbucks, I followed these steps:

1.Identified the URL of the Starbucks India locations page.
2.Made a GET request to the URL using the requests library.
3.Parsed the HTML content using BeautifulSoup to extract the desired data.
4.Used CSS selectors to extract the store name, address, timings, and phone number from each store location element.
5.Used the Geopy library to extract the store coordinates from the store address using geocoding.
6.Stored the extracted data in a list of dictionaries.
7.Wrote the data to a CSV file using the csv module.
8.The main challenge faced in this approach was to extract the store coordinates. Since the store coordinates were not provided on the 9.Starbucks India locations page, I had to use an external API to geocode the store address and extract the coordinates. In this case, I used the Geopy library, which provides a convenient interface to various geocoding services.

Another challenge I faced was that some store location elements on the page did not have a phone number listed, which caused an error when trying to extract the phone number using a CSS selector. To overcome this, I used the .select_one() method instead of .select() to extract the phone number, which returns None if the element is not found and avoids the error.

Overall, web scraping Starbucks India locations was a relatively straightforward task once the necessary libraries and tools were set up. The use of external APIs like geocoding services can greatly enhance the accuracy and usefulness of the extracted data, but also adds an additional layer of complexity to the web scraping process.
